TO DO LIST:
-Change loadMap method so that it loads files exported from Tiled.(currently loads map from simplified file)
-Change the load Resources part in level so that the tileset directory comes from the Tiled file aswell.
-Change main game class. Get a class that contains all of the game resources. 
-Get some basic audio
-Get Mobs and all that crap
-Implement max fps without affecting movement of stuff
